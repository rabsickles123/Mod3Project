# Mod3Project - A Weather Mood Tracker
A weather diary/weather mood tracker!

## Introduction
This is my third and FINAL project for Per Scholas' software engineering training program!
It utilizes the full MERN tech stack that I have learned in the past four months.

## Getting Started and Planning

Planning for a project of this scope was chaotic. There wasn't a concrete idea on what
exactly the project was going to be. The WeatherApp from MOD 2 was going to be used to 
build upon but because weather is at present/right now thing that can easily be obtained 
through APIs and easily recorded, it seemed a little redundant to do. However, over time the 
idea evolved from tracking weather to weather news/weather articles to a weather diary to 
ultimately a weather mood tracker.

## Technologies Used
Backend: MongoDB, Express, Node.js
Front-End: React and CSS 
Postman for testing Backend routes
API: Openweathermap.org (Geocoding API and One Call API)

## Unsolved Problems
Individual users are not recognized. All registered users can see and update all diary entries.
Needs to be updated.

## Future Enhancements
Definitely will be changing the diary entries to something a little more specific to mood tracking 
and the weather of each user's specific location with date and live weather stamps instead of the
relatively vague title and text options in the diary.
